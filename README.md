# Custom Loss Function in TensorFlow for Binary Classification

This repository demonstrates how to implement and use a **custom loss function** in TensorFlow for a simple binary classification task. The model is built using standard Keras layers and trained on synthetic numeric data.

The project includes training visualization with loss and accuracy plots, as well as evaluation via confusion matrix.
